# The 2014 Montpelier Rally

Misalots’i, dzvirp’aso megobrebo! (That’s Georgian for “greetings, dear friends”...but you probably knew that already.) On Saturday, three-fourths of Team Crossing the Rubikhan ventured to the alien hamlet of Montpelier, Vermont – typically written in the Latin script as Montpelier, Vermont – in pursuit of adventure, camaraderie, and international driver’s permits. A mini-rally of sorts, this day-long excursion offered Nick, Shav, and Cooper a brief taste of the long hours of driving that await them this summer. As is common with adventures of this magnitude (Jason’s quest for the golden fleece springs to mind), we encountered a few potentially catastrophic trials along the way. First, we drove to a defunct AAA office, which looked suspiciously like a meth lab. Then, we somehow managed to get lost, despite the presence of three GPS devices in the car. Once we found the real AAA office, poor left-handed Nick had to fill out an entire page of paperwork without smearing the ink. And finally, we nearly lost Shav to a powerful gust of wind. The fact that we overcame all of these obstacles in order to complete our mission-critical objectives surely testifies to our preparedness for the Mongol Rally. To reward ourselves for our hard labor, the three of us treated ourselves to <s>several gallons of</s> some delicious artisanal beer from the [highly acclaimed Hill Farmstead Brewery](http://www.craftbeer.com/news/brewery-news/hill-farmstead-brewery-named-best-brewery-in-the-world-2013). Unfortunately, the company was unwilling to sponsor us through an in-kind donation...but in all fairness, they’re probably not quite ready to expand into the Uzbek market yet. In due time. Anyway, here are a few of photos from the excursion:

Nick and Shav flaunt their hard-earned credentials. Fortunately, there was no driving test, which Shav indubitably would have failed. ![](/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0041.jpg)

We weren’t kidding about #sidemirrorsaturday. It’s a thing now. Twitter, take notice. ![](/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0031.jpg)

Nick nervously pilots us along a dirt road. (He was mostly concerned about getting dirt on his car.) ![](/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0051.jpg)

Shav and Cooper put on their best beer faces. ![](/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/DSC_0047.jpg) Did you notice Cooper’s super-limited-edition Crossing the Rubikhan t-shirt, courtesy of our friends at [Big Frog](http://www.bigfrog.com/)? It’s pretty sweet, right? Well, if you’d like to purchase one for yourself, now you can! Just holler at us – we have them in a range of sizes, and one shirt’ll set you back just $15. We can take Venmo (preferred), cash (also pretty good), Paypal (good), checks (less good) or 14W meal swipes. Stay tuned for more updates in the near future. //Cooper and Team Crossing the Rubikhan
