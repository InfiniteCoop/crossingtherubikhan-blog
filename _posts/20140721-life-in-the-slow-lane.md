# Life in the Slow Lane

Hello from Prague! It’s been a whirlwind of driving so far and we’ve safely made it out of Western Europe into the warm embrace of Central Europe’s economic, cultural, and only center. We awoke at the crack of dawn yesterday to join the ~250 other teams at the Mongol Rally starting line in London’s Battersea Park. After waiting a couple hours for our turn to process out of the park and begin our journey (read: get the h*ll on the road already) we finagled our car off the steep platform that served as the official launch and promptly slammed our sump guard into the ground. Five feet into the Rally and our car already has battle scars. Needless to say, we powered on — and made great time to the English Channel ferry, where we reunited with dozens of other Rally teams. After a ferry ride chatting with the other teams, napping, and cautiously watching our car to make sure it didn’t fall into the channel, we made it to France. Thirty minutes later we made it out of France and to Veurne, a picturesque Belgian town where my (Nick’s) great-grandmother saved and resurrected a bombed-out hotel just after WWI. And we found the plaque to prove it! After receiving marriage advice from a local (and inebriated) couple, we hit the road again and drove straight through to Germany. We were disappointed to race through Belgium, passing up the chance to visit Bruges and Ghent, which were just off the highway. But for the first couple days our goal has been singular: get to Prague. Making the mistake of not booking a room beforehand, we tried our luck hostel-searching in central Cologne. We ran into two other Ralliers at a gas station on the way in, and we caravanned on into town looking like a fun-sized version of an expedition party. Cologne was gorgeous, even at 11 at night, and apparently a bunch of other people thought so too because neither of the youth hostels we stopped into had space for us — although our new friends lucked out with a couple beds (they only had two left). So we learned our lesson to book our hostels ahead of time and we tried our luck back out on the highway where we promptly found a traveler’s motel. We pulled up to the motel where a little sign directed us to go to reception, which was a quarter mile back down the road in a service station. Skeptical, we walked to the station where sure enough we found the reception and sure enough they had a room for us. It seemed like we were the only guests in the creepy, dimly lit building but we didn’t care. We had beds, we had beers, and we could promptly pass out. Today has mercifully been less eventful. Crossing central Germany has taught us that while German cars are extremely fast, German trucks are still incredibly slow. And on a two-lane highway, there’s no middle ground (or middle lane) so we stuck to the right, sporadically finding the cajones to pass a lumbering lorry. Several hundred kilometers and one near-fuel emergency later, we safely arrived in Prague. Now excuse us while Cooper and I have a couple Pilsners and drag Benjie around our old stomping grounds. Na zdravi! Nick, Cooper, and Benjie PS these photos really don't do our car justice – we're still waiting for the perfect sunset. Also, our satellite tracker is finally up and running. Stay tuned for the interactive map showing our path and current location. ![OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA](/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/P71901261-1024x768.jpg)Friendly folk at the launch in Battersea ![OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA](http://crossingtherubikhan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/P7200160-1024x768.jpg)Benjie shows off our rudimentary auxiliary sound system, courtesy of [Goal Zero](http://goalzero.com) ![OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA](http://crossingtherubikhan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/P7200156-1024x768.jpg)7:00am team photo at Battersea...Cooper is still waking up ![OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA](http://crossingtherubikhan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/P7200166-1024x768.jpg)Fiending for [Cool Moon](http://www.coolmoonicecream.com) ice cream on the ferry! ![OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA](http://crossingtherubikhan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/P7200170-1024x768.jpg)The central <del>parking lot</del> square of Veurne, Belgium ![OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA](http://crossingtherubikhan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/P7200174-1024x768.jpg)Nick discovers the plaque commemorating his great-grandparents ![OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA](http://crossingtherubikhan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/P7200182-1024x768.jpg)Blazing through Germany
