# Captain's Log: February Doldrums Lead to March Madness

<p>What’s up RubikhanArtists?</p>
<p>The weather remains unforgivably cold in Hanover (negative 8°F next week? In March?) and Team Crossing the Rubikhan is dreaming of 96-degree days on the M37 highway between Turkmenbashi and Ashgabat. While waiting to receive our second passports—just in case the rogue border patrolman is less than pumped about the two Israeli stamps I have on page 7—we’ve begun to prepare the rest of our applications for visas.</p>
<p>For those of you who are unfamiliar with the process, applying for one visa can be a bureaucratic nightmare. We need six each—and that includes Russia: The Visa To End All Visas. This means we need to confirm hostel bookings, procure our international driver's licenses, fill out mounds of paperwork, and somehow convince a series of questionably run government agencies that driving a beat up old car from the UK to Mongolia is a perfectly legitimate and not-at-all-sketchy reason to gain ingress into their esteemed nation.</p>
<p>Cooper is going bald trying to keep the rest of us on top of our responsibilities while other serious obligations like schoolwork and Sporcle fight for our extremely limited attention (thanks, technology!). The team is hoping for a miracle tomorrow when the four of us make the quick jaunt to Montpelier to get our international driver’s licenses. There have been murmurs from Benjie that preparing for a certain fraternity formal may get in the way. We get it, Benjie—you have a hot date. You're still coming. Pics to follow (of the Montpelier trip, not of Benjie’s hot date). Maybe this will be the first installment of <a href="http://tripwing.com" title="Tripwing's" target="_blank">Tripwing’s</a> highly anticipated #SideMirrorSaturday?</p>
<p>That’s all we’ve got for now. Like always, thanks a ton to all of our incredible donors and sponsors! Special shout-out to <a href="http://www.goalzero.com/" title="GoalZero" target="_blank">GoalZero</a> for sending us some amazing solar-powered gear. </p>
