Thanks for visiting our blog. We’ll be using this space to keep everyone informed on how our preparations are progressing, and of course how the drive is going once the rally actually begins. But that’s still pretty far off; for now, we need to deal with some basic necessities. Like a car! If you’d like to help us out in that department, head on down to the “Get Involved” section of the website, where you can conveniently donate through PayPal. Remember that the majority of your donation will go to help keep the earth cool and shelter orphaned children, two causes I think we can all agree are very worthwhile. So please consider supporting us!
