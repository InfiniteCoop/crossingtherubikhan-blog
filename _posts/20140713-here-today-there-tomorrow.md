# Here Today, There Tomorrow...

<p>Greetings everyone,</p>
<p>Well, the day has finally arrived—after over a year of plotting, planning, and preparing, we have packed our bags, charged our camera batteries, and said our goodbyes, and in just a couple of hours, we'll fly to London to begin our grand adventure. </p>
<p>For months, we’ve looked forward to this trip with tremendous anticipation. And yet, until just a few days ago, we weren't even sure if we could pull it off. But now that our affairs are (mostly) in order, the reality of the situation is finally sinking in. It’s both exhilarating and anxiety-inducing. It seems nearly impossible to account for the myriad little details that might rear their ugly heads at some point: do we need more than one spare tire? How much money will we need for bribes? Do the Turkmen border guards allow prescription drugs into the country? Did Nick just leave his passport on the copy machine at the FedEx store? (Yeah, but no worries, we got it back).</p>
<p>That being said, at this point, we accept the fact that we can’t think of everything, and that some things are simply out of our control. Things will go wrong, and they should—that’s part of the experience, and one of our main goals for the trip is to live in the moment and expect the unexpected. So when we get held up at the Russia-Mongolia border for two days in the middle of a snowstorm and only get through by giving up a hundred bucks and our last bottle of Jack Daniel's, we’ll be smiling, because those are the parts of the trip that might turn out to be the most memorable.</p>
<p>Speaking of bribes, we could still use some extra cash because truly it’s impossible to anticipate how much we will need. Many of you have already donated, and we are incredibly appreciative. But if anyone else is inclined to throw a few bucks our way, we can assure you that they won’t go to waste. Unless you think that giving them to a corrupt Kazakh police officer is a waste, in which case we won’t be offended if you choose to keep them for yourself. You can easily donate by <a href="http://www.crossingtherubikhan.com/blog" title="Blog" target="_blank">clicking right here</a>. In return for your support, we can offer you some sweet rewards, like postcards, trinkets, and even personal video messages from the road. And don’t forget, a portion of your donation will go to our two charities: SOS Children’s Villages, and Cool Earth.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you’ve donated, we hope you’ll enjoy following along with us. We tested our satellite internet router yesterday and it works perfectly, so we will be updating this page throughout the trip with pictures and anecdotes from the road. And lastly, if you’ve already donated more than $25, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13XRsQQbZKVYTJHnIpe6w6W8fgRDtVoMXqNGp1cqSibk/viewform?usp=send_form" title="Donor Address" target="_blank">click here and enter your address</a> so that we can send your rewards to you!</p>
<p>A huge thank you again for all of your support, and we'll update you from London. Alea Yakta Est!</p>
<p>Cheers,
Benjie, Cooper, and Nick</p>
