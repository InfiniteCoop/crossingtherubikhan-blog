# The 2014 Montpelier Rally

<p>Misalots’i, dzvirp’aso megobrebo! (That’s Georgian for “greetings, dear friends”...but you probably knew that already.) </p>
<p>On Saturday, three-fourths of Team Crossing the Rubikhan ventured to the alien hamlet of Montpelier, Vermont – typically written in the Latin script as Montpelier, Vermont – in pursuit of adventure, camaraderie, and international driver’s permits. A mini-rally of sorts, this day-long excursion offered Nick, Shav, and Cooper a brief taste of the long hours of driving that await them this summer.</p>
<p>As is common with adventures of this magnitude (Jason’s quest for the golden fleece springs to mind), we encountered a few potentially catastrophic trials along the way. First, we drove to a defunct AAA office, which looked suspiciously like a meth lab. Then, we somehow managed to get lost, despite the presence of three GPS devices in the car. Once we found the real AAA office, poor left-handed Nick had to fill out an entire page of paperwork without smearing the ink. And finally, we nearly lost Shav to a powerful gust of wind. The fact that we overcame all of these obstacles in order to complete our mission-critical objectives surely testifies to our preparedness for the Mongol Rally. </p>
<p>To reward ourselves for our hard labor, the three of us treated ourselves to <s>several gallons of</s> some delicious artisanal beer from the <a href="http://www.craftbeer.com/news/brewery-news/hill-farmstead-brewery-named-best-brewery-in-the-world-2013" title="Hill Farmstead Brewery Named Best Brewery in the World 2013" target="_blank">highly acclaimed Hill Farmstead Brewery</a>. Unfortunately, the company was unwilling to sponsor us through an in-kind donation...but in all fairness, they’re probably not quite ready to expand into the Uzbek market yet. In due time. Anyway, here are a few of photos from the excursion:</p>

<p text align="center">We weren’t kidding about #sidemirrorsaturday. It’s a thing now. Twitter, take notice.

Did you notice Cooper’s super-limited-edition Crossing the Rubikhan t-shirt, courtesy of our friends at <a href="http://www.bigfrog.com/" title="Big Frog" target="_blank">Big Frog</a>? It’s pretty sweet, right? Well, if you’d like to purchase one for yourself, now you can! Just holler at us – we have them in a range of sizes, and one shirt’ll set you back just $15. We can take Venmo (preferred), cash (also pretty good), Paypal (good), checks (less good) or 14W meal swipes. 

Stay tuned for more updates in the near future.
