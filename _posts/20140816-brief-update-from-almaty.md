# Brief Update from Almaty

Greetings from Almaty, Kazakhstan, where we arrived late last night. Since our last dispatch, we’ve enjoyed three truly incredible days of driving. First, we descended into Uzbekistan’s fecund Fergana Valley, crossed the border into Kyrgyzstan, and enjoyed a wonderful homecooked meal in the region's cultural capital, Osh. Then, we headed north into the foothills of the Tien Shan mountain range, and camped by a massive, emerald-blue reservoir. And yesterday, we continued our climb through the Tien Shan, passing over two 10,000-foot passes before descending into Bishkek (where Cooper will be living next year), crossing into Kazakhstan, and bombing across the motorway to Almaty in time for a late dinner and a round of cold beers. We’re eager to hit the road this morning, and so we don’t have time for a full update, but we’ll provide you with a full rundown of the past few days as soon as we have wifi again. Remember, you can check out our [live-tracking map](https://spotwalla.com/tripViewer.php?id=a9f453c8530592eec) to view our progress. Below are a couple photos to whet your appetite for the full post. ![OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA](/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/P8141394.jpg)Chaikhana lunch in central Uzbekistan ![OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA](http://crossingtherubikhan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/P8141405.jpg)Tearing across the Fergana Valley ![OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA](http://crossingtherubikhan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/P8161498.jpg)Yurts in the Tien Shan Mountains ![OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA](http://crossingtherubikhan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/P8161481.jpg)Benjie and Cooper celebrate the high altitude mark of the trip (somewhere around 12,000ft), while Nick ogles a rock ![OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA](http://crossingtherubikhan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/P8161532.jpg)Late-night driver swap, somewhere in Kazakhstan
