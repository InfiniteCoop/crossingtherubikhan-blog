# Friendships and Sponsorships

Dear Friends, Family, and Other Loyal Followers, I write to you as our time at Dartmouth comes to a close—tomorrow our family members roll in and we prepare to say our long goodbyes. (To Dartmouth—not to our parents, hopefully.) Cooper, Benjie, and I have spent this past week maximizing time with the closest friends we’ve ever had and reflecting on the past four years—on our adventures, misadventures, our stresses and our joys. Never has it been so apparent that the important moments, the times that will stick with us as we go on to Lyon, Bishkek, and New York (spelling?) are the times when we abandoned the comforts of everyday living and did something crazy. When Cooper and I traversed a raging Icelandic river in order to reach an abandoned swimming pool, when team member-emeritus Keshav and I found the best looking gas masks in all of Central Europe, and when Benjie descended into the Parisian catacombs, but not the ones you’re thinking of. Reflecting on the tremendous memories we made in our four years here has reaffirmed why we’re doing this—why we’re dropping everything to take a piece-of-junk Suzuki 10,000 miles across some of the most remote landscapes on Earth. We’re doing it because leaving Dartmouth will not mean the end of adventures together. The experiences we’ll share on the Rally will be some of the most incredible we’ve ever had. And they’ll last a lifetime. ![team_photo-01](/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/team_photo-011.jpg) As we mope and hug and stay up way too late, we’ve found solace from nostalgia by thinking forward to the Rally. We’ve been extremely fortunate to land a couple of key sponsorships in the past couple of weeks. We’d like to give a big shout out to Jason at [Vision Sign](http://www.visionsign.net/) for generously taking care of our car decals (reader vote: racing stripes, flames, or a life-size sticker of Ruth Bader Ginsburg?). Thanks to Vision Sign's help, we might actually be able to conceal the overall crappiness of our car! You can check out some of their sweet work by clicking on the image below, or heading to their [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/visionsignDMV?fref=ts). ![Vision_Sign_logo-01](http://crossingtherubikhan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Vision_Sign_logo-01.png) We’re still in the market for a bunch of smaller items that could make all the difference in the world to us. Check out our wish list [here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/1BNZH15BXHE0D/ref=cm_sw_su_w) and see if there’s anything you’d like to sponsor for us. We’ll even name it after you! The Jen R. S. Doenor Memorial Tire Iron Set has a certain ring to it, doesn’t it? Talk to you when we’re college graduates! Nick
