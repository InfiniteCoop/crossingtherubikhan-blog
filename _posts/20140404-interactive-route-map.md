# Interactive Route Map

Hello again, Rubikhaners! For those of you who don’t know, Cooper loves making maps. I love looking at maps (and making map legends with comically large north arrows). This winter, we had the opportunity to combine our two (equally impressive) skill sets to create an interactive Crossing the Rubikhan route map for the final project in our geovisualization class. While the end product isn't exactly what our dear professor had in mind ("no compass rose?!?!"), we hope it’ll be an acceptable resource for all of you loyal supporters as you follow us through some of this planet’s remarkable cities. So without further ado, we present to you our map! Click on the image below to launch the real thing. //Nick ![MapLaunchIcon](/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/MapLaunchIcon.png)
