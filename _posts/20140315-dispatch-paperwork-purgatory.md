# A Dispatch from Paperwork Purgatory

<p><em>“[Paperwork] destroys memory and weakens the mind, relieving it of…work that makes it strong. [Paperwork] is an inhuman thing.”</em></p>
<p><em></em>—Socrates</p>
<p>Some people claim that paperwork can be fun. But this week, we (the Rubikhans) collectively decided that these people are either liars, idiots, or soulless drones. Seeking an escape from our daunting academic responsibilities—final examinations were this week—we woke up at the crack of dawn (read: noon) a few days ago to fill out the visa applications that have been hanging over our heads for the past few months. Naturally, this process—which we naively expected to take just a couple of hours—dragged into an agonizingly tedious weeklong activity, and one that we’ll be happy to forget.</p>
<p>See, as American citizens, we need visas for Turkey, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Russia (the Big Six). Fortunately, the ’Stans offer a great "buy four, get one free” visa deal, maybe inspired by Domino’s Pizza’s hugely successful Five Five Five marketing campaign, so Kyrgyzstan was exempted from our list. (Kidding.) Unfortunately, however, most of of these countries require proof of travel insurance, proof of sufficient funds, proof of accommodation, and proof of existence. So, we hastily made a few fake hotel bookings (all at five-star resorts, of course), procured some budget insurance, scratched out a couple of letters with our names signed in blood, and then dove headfirst into the mountain of paperwork itself.</p>

<p>And what a mountain it was. As we slogged through tens of impossibly formatted pages and dozens of unintelligible questions, like “direction of activity of organization” (north?), “location of border” (uh, the border?), and “have you ever visited other countries in the past ten years?", our mid-morning gumption deteriorated into mid-afternoon frustration. Even Google Maps seemed determined to thwart our progress, telling us to fly from Tashkent to Bishkek, rather than driving.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-920" alt="googleMaps" src="http://crossingtherubikhan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/googleMaps-1024x556.png" width="960" height="521" /></p>
<p>Finally, after four long, hand-cramping hours of paperwork, our work was done. We stacked up all of our applications, passports, international driver’s permits, personal letters, photos, and booking “confirmations", and dropped them in the mail, along with a hope and a prayer that our passports would come back to us with six beautiful visa stickers – or even at all.</p>

<p>Now, fast forward some 48 hours. On the first day of exams, we all awoke to a dishearteningly lengthy email from the visa processing company informing us that our applications were missing certain documents, that we had answered some questions incorrectly, and that we were getting dangerously close to the Turkmenistan visa application deadline. Naturally, our hearts sank. Determined to finish this daunting task before parting ways for spring break, however, we grudgingly reprinted blank forms, re-answered questions, re-wrote letters, re-scanned the completed documents, and repackaged them for delivery.</p>
<p>With a bit of luck, our applications will actually go through this time around. And if not, we’ll just have to figure out an alternate route that bypasses all official border crossings. That shouldn’t be a problem, right?</p>
