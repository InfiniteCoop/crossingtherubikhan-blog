# Happy New Year!

<p>It's 2014 in Mongolia!</p>
<p>Beloved friends, family, and people who read obscure blogs for fun: I wanted to take a few minutes to update you on our preparations—at least those outside of calculating carbon footprints and monkey mischief quotients. In the midst of our holiday break, Cooper, Benjie, Keshav, and I have struck a delicate balance between Rally preparations, sleeping, and catching up on Homeland.</p>
<p>On top of finding generous sponsors and watching Cooper build us a beautiful interactive map, we’ve allowed ourselves to dive into the nitty gritty of day to day equipment needs (sample: 4 headlamps, 2 walkie talkies, 1 car).</p>
<p>We’ve nailed down the hilariously bureaucratic means through which we will secure our visas. I’ll double check with Keshav but I think Turkmenistan requires $40 cash and a floral offering from the eldest member of our village.</p>
<p>We’ve reached out for advice wherever we can get it. Thanks to everyone for the invaluable recommendations regarding everything from bribes to brakepads. A couple of favorite pieces of advice have been to chat up that locals as much as we can and to politely refuse offerings of snuff by sniffing it and finding a way to adequately pantomime ‘no thank you.’</p>
<p>We have our work cut out for us with seven months until we launch in London. Our biggest tasks include acquiring a car, learning how to drive it, and learning how to fix it. Piece of cake, right?</p>
<p>Before I sign off, I want to say a huge thanks to all who have donated! We cannot properly express just how much it means that you’re supporting our causes as well as our dream of adventure. Also, shout out to <a href="http://bigfrog.com/pdx" title="Big Frog Custom T-Shirts" target="_blank">Big Frog Custom T-Shirts</a> in Portland for printing up some great looking t-shirts (look out for ‘em on campus this winter!).</p>
<p>And if you’re feeling in the holiday spirit and want to fund a fan belt or our passage across the Caspian, I encourage you to visit our <a href="http://crossingtherubikhan.com/#donate" title="Donations Page" target="_blank">donations page</a> and check out the wonderfully weird rewards packages we’ll give you in return.</p>
<p>Hobey Ho, let’s go!</p>
<p>//Nick</p>
