# A Culture a Day...

<p>Hello Friends!</p>
<p>We’re pumped to announce our new partnership with <a href="http://www.tripwing.com" title="TripWing" target="_blank">TripWing</a>—a travel itinerary booking website that books entire tours along with the standard flight and hotel reservations. While they probably can’t help us pitch a tent in the Turkmen desert, they can do pretty much everything else travel related. Check out everything TripWing can do by visiting their <a href="http://www.tripwing.com" title="website" target="_blank">website</a>. Oh yeah, and feel free to check out our <a href="http://crossingtherubikhan.com/#donate" title="donations page" target="_blank">donations page</a> too….</p>
<p>Until next time, here’s a list of weird cultural idiosyncrasies we’re likely to encounter on our drive: </p>
<p text align=center><strong>Obscure Customs We’ll Inevitably Break Along the Way</strong></p>

<p><strong>Turkey:</strong> Holding your thumb between your index and middle finger is the equivalent of flipping the bird and to be avoided at all costs. While not verified by any reputable source, this likely stems from too many lost noses in the “Got Your Nose!” disaster of 1963.</p>
<p><strong>Azerbaijan:</strong> If you meet a person with empty buckets, you are bound for misfortune. Cast down your bucket where you are!</p>
<p><strong>Uzbekistan:</strong> Refilling a guest’s teacup that is more than half-full is a rude way of saying that you want them to leave. After three smelly weeks packed into a tiny car, this technique may be abetted by good old-fashioned passive aggression.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia:</strong> Bring an odd number of flowers, as even numbers are used in funerals. This means that when Benjie buys a dozen roses from the Tbilisi florist, he can give 11 to his crush and still have one left over for his ego.</p>
<p><strong>Kyrgyzstan:</strong> If a bottle of vodka is opened, it must be finished in one sitting. Good luck, Keshav.</p>
<p><strong>Kazakhstan:</strong> A boiled sheep’s head is sometimes presented on a beautiful plate to the most honored guest, who then symbolically serves sections of the head among the guests. The daughter-in-law and host’s daughter are given sections of the tongue as a reminder to ‘hold their tongues.’ Cooper will presumably be given the teeth as a reminder to brush his teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Russia:</strong> Do not bring yellow flowers; it is a sign of cheating on love. I don’t know why these etiquette websites are so obsessed with flowers.</p>
<p><strong>Uzbekistan:</strong> Partially because unemployment is rampant, people generally have a lot of free time. There is no set bus schedule: buses generally just run whenever they fill up/feel like it. Translation: if our car breaks down in Uzbekistan, we'd better not be in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>Mongolia:</strong> If you accidentally tap someone’s foot with your own, immediately shake hands with him. Since Mongolia is the most sparsely populated country in the world, I can’t imagine this has ever happened.</p>
<p><strong>Turkmenistan:</strong> Narrowly beating out Justin Bieber as the most bizarre cult of personality this side of North Korea, Turkmenistan’s former President For Life, Saparmurat Niyazov is one crazy individual. He renamed himself Turkmenbashi, meaning “Father of all Turkmen” and subsequently renamed several cities, towns, streets, and the month of January after himself. There is a 50ft tall golden statue of him in the capital that rotates so as to always face the sun. While Turkmenbashi died in 2006, a book promulgating his glory,written by none other than Turkmenbashi himself, is still taught in all Turkmen schools. My guess would be to avoid making fun of this dude until we hit the Uzbek border.</p>
