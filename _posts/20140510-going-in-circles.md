# Going in Circles

<p>We owe a big thank you to our friend Nick – no, not <em>teammate</em> Nick – for providing us with some ace driving lessons yesterday. We mashed the living daylights out of the clutch in Nick's Audi, but he barely batted an eyelash. This was actually (teammate) Nick's first time driving a manual transmission, and by all accounts, he did a pretty good job! Benjie managed to capture Nick's first few seconds behind the wheel:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we're not sure if <a href="http://crossingtherubikhan.com/we-bought-a-car/" target="_blank">our 2004 Suzuki Alto</a> also comes equipped with a weighted shifter, a direct-shift gearbox, a dual clutch transmission, or any of the Audi's other drivetrain-related bells and whistles. And we're definitely not sure what any of these things actually do. But we do know that our car has four wheels, an engine, and a steering wheel, so we think we're in pretty good shape.</p>
<p>*UPDATE: our mechanic friend in the UK reports that our Alto needs new brake pads, but also has a working horn. So we're definitely in good shape. Stay tuned for more!</p>
<p>*UDPATE #2: on Monday, the Rubikhans got their first lesson in auto repair: Moral of the story? We must not destroy our Alto's transmission!</p>
