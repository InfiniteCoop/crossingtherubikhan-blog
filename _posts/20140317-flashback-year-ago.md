# Flashback To A Year Ago

<p>Exactly one year ago today, Nick and I (Cooper) woke up bright and early to drive our crappy 3-door rental car from Reykjavik, Iceland's charming capital, to the tiny fishing village of Vik some 100 miles to the east. Over the next 12 hours, we would swim in an abandoned geothermal pool carved into the side of a mountain, ogle some of the most magnificent waterfalls on this planet, "pilot" the decaying wreck of a U.S. Navy airplane that crashed on the black sand beach in the 1970s, and watch the northern lights dance in the clear night skies. Iceland is easily the most strikingly beautiful place I’ve ever been, and its grandiose, alien landscapes are burned into my memory clear as day.</p>
<p>Not long before we visited Iceland, Nick and I had casually discussed doing the Mongol Rally, and so I think we both saw the weeklong trip as a sort of test run for a much longer excursion to come. It can be exhausting and infuriating to spend so much time in the company of just one other person, and naturally, this trip tested our patience (and our friendship!). But despite a few hiccups here and there, Nick and I had a incredible time in Iceland, and as I reflect on where I was a year ago today (and on that trip at large), I’m filled with nothing but happiness and thanks. I know that this probably sounds sappy and cliche, but it's the truth.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the most unpleasant in-the-moment experiences often produce the most powerful, evocative, and humorous memories down the road. And so while I am quite sure that our trip this summer will have its fair share of unpleasant moments, I know that it will remain with us for the rest of our lives. And that pretty exciting.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough of that. To reward you for your patience, here are a few photos I took on 17 March 2013 (cropped to 16:9 just for fun).</p>

<p>I really look forward to visually documenting our adventure this summer. To do this correctly, however, I'll need a variety of filters, adapters, hoods, caps, tripods, tripod heads, cards, straps, batteries, and other doodads (not to mention the cameras and lenses themselves). So, if you have any old camera gear lying around that you think might come in handy on our trip – or better yet, if you’d like to sponsor the photography and videography components of our trip – don’t hesitate to holler. Rest assured, your donations will be put to good use.</p>
<p>And as always, we’d love to hear your thoughts on our trip, and/or any advice that you might have for us, so feel free to send us a message or leave a comment below.</p>
<p>Over and out.</p>

**[Tom Chokel](#20 "2014-03-20 23:15:39"):** Cooper! This sounds fucking incredible. I'm very excited for you guys and can't wait to hear about your adventures. If you haven't read it, I'd recommend picking up a copy of Vagabonding by Rolf Potts - not all of it will be relevant to your quest, but it's got some great practical advice on how to deal with life on the road. Also, no spending my donation on cooling the earth - those funds are strictly earmarked for creating a good story. Stay safe, take good notes, and kick somebody out of the group so I can tag along next year! Tom P. S. Your website is awesome. Who designed it?
