# Of Backpacks and Beacons

<p>What do you do when you lose the "nugget" part of your phone charger, and can't be bothered to replace it? Cooper found himself in this very predicament earlier this week. His solution? To ziptie our GoalZero Nomad 7 solar panel to his backpack, and recharge his phone using the power of the sun. Even in the absence of direct sunlight – what's that all about, anyway? – the panel has worked flawlessly. Plus, since wearable technologies are totally en vogue right now, Cooper is racking up some serious bonus points with all the fashion-forward ladies of Dartmouth (or so he claims). In any case, the Nomad 7 – and the other solar devices that <a href="http://crossingtherubikhan.com/captains-log-february-doldrums-lead-to-march-madness/" target="_blank">GoalZero sent us</a> – will definitely come in handy while we traverse the power-less Central Asian steppe. Especially since we haven't been able to find a 1,000-mile-long extension cord with an American-style three-prong plug. Yet. </p>

<p>Actually, the untethered power supplied by this solar panel has proven quite useful over the past few days, as Cooper has been testing several different GPS tracking apps in preparation for the rally. While we'll probably invest in a dedicated GPS tracker, the iPhone's built-in GPS offers a cheap alternative – albeit a very power-hungry one. We want to keep you abreast of our whereabouts, and so Cooper is working on integrating this data into our existing <a href="http://crossingtherubikhan.com/interactive-route-map/" target="_blank">interactive route map</a> in realtime. Stay tuned for details on that. And in the meantime, you can check out Cooper's movements over the last week. Can you identify his residence? Hint: it's not actually the computer science building. Or the middle of the Connecticut River.</p>
