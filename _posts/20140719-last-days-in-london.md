# Last Day(s) in London

Hello everyone! We've spent the past few days running a few last-minute errands in London, purchasing some crucial rally equipment like car tools and garish Hawaiian shirts, and, in our spare time, checking off some London tourism highlights. Today was an eventful day for us, as we went to pick up our car where we had left it in a car park in the London suburbs for the past few days, only to discover that the battery was completely dead. Fortunately, we found some nice chaps at a nearby auto repair shop who jumped it for us, and we're hoping that if we run the car a bit every day from now on she'll be okay. We do understand that there is a fine line between optimism and naïveté but knock on aluminum we won't have to cross it. After completing a jigsaw puzzle packing job we made it to Battersea Park where we were greeted by the most absurd collection of people and cars you will ever see. We chatted with tons of interesting characters who are all a bit nuts and very excited to get on the road. Tomorrow we will head out of London and make a beeline for the English Channel to hop on a ferry to France, and hopefully we'll be somewhere near Cologne, Germany tomorrow night. Stay tuned for more updates from the road! And don't forget that you you can also follow us on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/crossingtherubikhan) and Instagram @[therubikhans](http://www.instagram.com/therubikhans).
