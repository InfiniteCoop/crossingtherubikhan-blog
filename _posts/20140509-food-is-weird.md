# Food is Weird

<p>As we are now only two months from launch, Benjie is getting more and more conscious that there will be no escargot (outside of France) and my research tells me that there is no Chipotle in the Asian Steppe (yet). So instead, we’ve looked into some of the fine cuisine we’ll encounter when the Safeways start to become Less-than-Safeways.</p>
<p><strong>10 Weird Foods We’re Trying Before Ulaanbaatar
</strong>
<strong>1. Kokorec (Turkey):</strong> whenever I eat sheep intestines, I think about how much better they would taste barbecued. No longer! This popular street food is served quite spicy, regrettably masking the sweet sweet smell of intestine. Rumor has it that EBAs will soon offer a Buffalo Kokorec Pizza. </p>
<p><strong>2. Goat Blood Soup (Kyrgyzstan):</strong> unlike misnomers like “Prairie Oysters” and “Friendly’s,” this Kyrgyz delicacy is exactly what it sounds like. </p>
<p><strong>3. Beshbarmak (also Kyrgyzstan):</strong> called “Five Fingers” because it is eaten with one’s hands, this dish is a variety of diced meat and noodles, the centerpiece of which is a boiled sheep’s head (I guess the intestines are exported to Turkey). As we mentioned in an earlier post, the head is given to the most honored guest with other parts of the animal distributed to different family members according to ritual.</p>
<p><strong>4. Somsa (Uzbekistan):</strong> this cute looking pouch of dough is filled with whatever you’d like, which is more often than not the entirety of a large mammal of your (non-English speaking cook’s) choosing.</p>
<p><strong>5. Zungenwurst (Germany):</strong> a sausage made from pork blood and pickled ox tongue. And here you are thinking we wouldn’t face anything foul (or fowl) until Turkey (fowl)!</p>
<p><strong>6. Airag (Mongolia):</strong> not really a food but fermented horse milk doesn’t exactly fall into the ‘drink’ category either. Important note: if you are registering a Tier I Yurt party, you are allowed to serve fermented milk from no more than two (2) horse’s udders. There will be one walk-through.</p>
<p><strong>7. Plov (Everywhere):</strong> this amorphous dish isn’t gross in and of itself but past rally-ers tell us that it will become a staple of our diet once we cross east of the Caspian. It’s predominantly a rice dish, but chefs throw in whatever little pieces of meat and vegetables are within arm’s reach—so any of these first six dishes are fair game.</p>
<p><strong>8. Boodog (Mongolia):</strong> presumably named because of its capacity to scare, this is a goat carcass hung upside down, de-boned (?) and flipped inside out. It’s then cooked with a blowtorch. Because kitchens are overrated.</p>
<p><strong>9. Lososova Sandwich at Bageterie Boulevard (Czech Republic):</strong> probably the best item on the menu in Prague’s best casual sandwich shop, the Lososova combines fresh smoked salmon from the Czech Republic’s finest coastal fishing villages with unmatched Czech hospitality (they only sometimes grunt when you pay with a 200 kC bill).</p>
<p><strong>10. Hakarl (Iceland):</strong> you caught us, we’re not traveling through Iceland. But Cooper and I just wanted to show off that during our adventure in Iceland last year, we tried the infamous Hakarl...which is putrified shark meat. This “dish” is prepared by burying a whole shark under the sand for months until it grows a thick layer of mold. (Incidentally, the shark meat is fatally toxic when untreated.) The shark is then unearthed, the mold scraped off, and the shark diced into tiny, bite sized pieces. These pieces are served raw. See photo evidence below:</p>

<p>More updates soon! For now we're looking to afford <del datetime="2014-05-09T19:42:58+00:00">spare</del> missing parts for our beloved new car in case it gets sick so feel free to donate <a href="www.crossingtherubikhan.com/donate" title="here" target="_blank">here</a>!</p>
<p>Until next time,
