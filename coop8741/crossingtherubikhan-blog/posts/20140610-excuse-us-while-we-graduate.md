# Excuse Us While We Graduate

The title of this post says it all, really. On Sunday, Benjie, Cooper, and Nick received their undergraduate diplomas, capping off four years of hard work (and hard play) at Dartmouth. Here are a couple very sweaty photos taken right after the ceremony. ![Graduation1](/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/P6080433.jpg) ![Graduation2](http://crossingtherubikhan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/P6080442.jpg) To our dear families: thank you for your tireless support over the past four years. And thank you for sanctioning our plan to drive to Mongolia, crazy and ambitious though it may be. We probably would have done it without your approval, so we're glad that you're behind it as well. Full steam ahead!
