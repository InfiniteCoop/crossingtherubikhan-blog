# These Are A Few Of Our Favorite Things

Merhaba! (That's hello in Turkish).** **Our July launch date is rapidly approaching, but truth be told, we still lack a considerable amount of mission-critical equipment. This includes things like a tent, a tool set, and lots and lots of baby wipes. So, if you own and are willing to part with any of the items on the following list – or are willing to "sponsor" us through the purchase of one or more of these things – please don't hesitate to reach out to us. They don't need to be the latest and greatest models – they just have to help us reach Mongolia! We plan to donate most, if not all, of this equipment to charity once we arrive in Ulaanbaatar. And we'll happily [reward](http://www.crossingtherubikhan.com/#donate) you for your contributions. Fortunately, we've already managed to secure some of the most expensive equipment we'll need through sponsorships from two companies that we are very excited to be working with. [GoalZero](http://www.goalzero.com), an innovator of high-quality portable solar power products, has generously sent us two solar panel charging units as well as a super-bright lantern for our campsite, and speakers that blast music for 20 hours on a mere 2 hour charge so we can take a break from listening to Nick's jokes. In addition, [Roadpost Satcom](http://www.roadpost.com) will soon be providing us with a satellite phone and internet router that will create a WiFi hotspot for us literally in the middle of the Gobi Desert - pretty cool, eh? That means we'll be able to keep you all updated no matter where we are. But don't worry, transmitting data is far too expensive to do all of the time, so chances are still high that we'll spend plenty of time completely lost. Fortunately, the rest of the equipment we need is much less expensive--but as we've already discovered, these small expenses can add up quickly. To make things easier for you, we've even prepared an [Amazon wishlist](http://amzn.com/w/1BNZH15BXHE0D), which'll allow you to order the things we need and ship them to Benjie's house where we are staging things before our departure to the UK. You can sort sort the items by priority and price (most of them are less than $40). We'll do our best to keep this list updated. On a related note, if you work for a company that produces or sells any of these products, and you'd like to arrange a sponsorship agreement with our team, don't hesitate to [contact us](http://www.crossingtherubikhan.com/#contact). You can can learn more about the perks of sponsorship on our [sponsors page](http://www.crossingtherubikhan.com/#sponsor). Alternatively, you can make a direct donation right [here](http://www.crossingtherubikhan.com/#donate). Anyway, here's some of the stuff we still need: [one_half]
