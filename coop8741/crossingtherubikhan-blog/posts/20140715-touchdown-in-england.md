# Touchdown in England

Hello everyone! We’ve been in this strange land called England for nearly two days now—reconciling the peculiarities of the land (left side of the road, silly accents, no trash cans) with how much more peculiar the lands we’re about to experience are going to be. After toasting America in an airport bar—by watching the World Cup final (naturally)—we were one overnight flight, rush-hour tube ride, and double-decker bus away from our temporary base in London. A friend from school has generously taken us in, providing us with the finest lodgings we’re likely to see for quite a while. We’d like to thank Sophia and the whole Johnston family for making our adjustment as comfortable as possible by giving us a cozy home base, beds, and delicious first dinner...and for joining me (Nick) on an impromptu trip to the pharmacy, because it’s better to get food poisoning here than in Kazakhstan! To stave off sleep on the first day, we poked around Chelsea, stumbled upon the noontime changing of the guards at Buckingham Palace, met a friend of Benjie’s for a couple pints, and hopped back on the Piccadilly line for a quick pre-dinner siesta. Cooper and a food-poisoned Nick (he’s better now, Mom) returned to the Johnston household while Benjie chose to sit under a tree in Hyde Park and write in his journal, because of course he did. With a feast in our bellies, we promptly passed out so that we could awake in time for our super-early (11:45am) train to our car in Canterbury. Spoiler alert: we still missed our train. But we made the next one, and soon arrived at the workshop of our mechanic friend Errol to find our noble beast replete with roof rack, sump guard, and two giant monster truck headlights. She looks like an awkward bug. But she's our awkward bug. Benjie took the wheel first, and thankfully succeeded in not embarrassing us as we navigated the manual car off the farm and directly onto the highway. When Cooper and Nick tried their hand at the wheel later, a quick series of stall-outs, including a few in the middle of an intersection, dissuaded them from taking it the rest of the way to the hotel. So with Benjie at the wheel, we drove into the coastal town of Gillingham for a few brews and some fish & chips. Back to London tomorrow. Below are a few photos from the past couple days. We wanted to wait until decorating the car to post pictures. Stay tuned for her official unveiling!
