# I Scream for Ice Cream

We love ice cream—so much, in fact, that for a while, we considered driving to Mongolia in a fully functioning ice cream truck (much like [this one](http://image.minitruckinweb.com/f/events/west/1109mt_danger_zone_2011_custom_truck_show/33390154/1109mt-03%2Bdanger-zone-2011-custom-truck-show%2Bice-cream-truck.jpg)). Sadly, however, we reluctantly abandoned that dream when we realized that camping gear takes precedence over delicious frozen snacks. Undeterred, however, we have settled for the next best thing: a partnership with [Cool Moon Ice Cream Co.](http://coolmoonicecream.com/), a fantastic ice cream shop located in the heart of downtown Portland. ![CoolMoon_Logo-01](/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/CoolMoon_Logo-01.png) Unlike most ice cream shops, Cool Moon makes all of its flavors on-site, one batch at a time, just meters away from the dipping cabinets. Consequently, the wizards in the kitchen are constantly experimenting with different ingredients and prototyping new flavors. They've engineered with some truly tastetacular delicacies, such as Thai Iced Tea, Kulfi (a take on the pistachio-, cardamom-, and rosewater-based Indian dessert), and Oakshire Espresso Stout (made with real beer, of course). However, the Cool Moon kitchen staff put the same amount of effort and care into their traditional flavors—based on our own experience, we can confidently say that Cool Moon's Indonesian Vanilla can't be beat, and that the shop's myriad berry flavors, most of which are produced using Oregon-grown (and, in the case of marionberry, Oregon-engineered!) berries, are downright addicting. Incidentally, Cooper spent two summers working at Cool Moon, and he makes an effort to visit the shop—and to stock his freezer—whenever he's in town. It's really that good. ![DSC_0025](http://crossingtherubikhan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/DSC_0025.jpg) (Above: patrons of all ages and sizes can enjoy Cool Moon's chill ambience) And now, to the _really_ good stuff: to support our journey and our charitable causes, **Cool Moon is producing a limited-edition ice cream flavor in honor of Team Crossing the Rubikhan!!** A portion of the ice cream's sales will go into the team's fund. The flavor is called NON SENSU COMMUNI, or NO COMMON SENSE. The title needs no explanation, but it’s the ingredients that make this flavor truly spectacular: a rich swirl of <del>goat blood</del> Oregon raspberries and three kinds of nuts (again, no explanation needed) blended into Cool Moon’s signature sweet cream base. It’s sure to be a crowd pleaser. ![DSC_0012](http://crossingtherubikhan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/DSC_0012-680x1024.jpg) (Above: ice cream master-chef Amy, hard at work. Note the tattoo!) Now, you’re probably asking yourselves, “how can I get my hands on some of this deliciousness?” Unfortunately, the ice cream is only available to local supporters, as we don’t have a dry ice budget. However, Portland residents are in luck: **Cooper will be doling out free samples of the ice cream at Cool Moon on First Thursday (July 3rd), from 6:00pm to 8:00pm**. Cool Moon is located on the corner of 11th Avenue and Johnson Street, just across the street to Jamison Square. Stop by, enjoy the ice cream, and say a prayer for Cooper and the team! ![DSC_0002](http://crossingtherubikhan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/DSC_0002.jpg) (Above: Cool Moon owner Eva Bernhard serves up a scoop of deliciousness) Again, here are the details of the event:
